# Deep-Learning-Assignment



Solve a machine learning problem that interests you! This is an open-ended assignment. You should use deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow) for this exercise.

You can find a lot of datasets here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets (Links to an external site.)

Do some preliminary exploratory analysis of your data (like we did in lecture 10.01).

You should upload a Jupyter notebook where the experiments are already completed (you have the output of the cells in the notebook).

If you need computing power and you don't have a GPU you may want to use Google Colab to access GPU-s for free: https://colab.research.google.com (Links to an external site.). You can download the Jupyter notebook from Colab using File=>Download .ipynb.
